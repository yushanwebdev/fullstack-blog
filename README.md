# Fullstack Blog

## Motivation

I always had an aspiration to develop an application from UI to hosting using the latest technologies. As a big fan of JavaScript, I discover that it is possible with JavaScript.

## Tasks

### Frontend Devlopment

- Develop necessary components UI & its functionalities.
- Use React Router to handle routing.
- Use React Hooks & Functional Components.

### Backend Development

- Setup **Babel** to use the latest JavaScript features.
- Setup **Nodemon** to monitor for any changes & restart the server.
- Setup **Express** as the backend application framework for **Node.js**.
- Setup the DB in a cluster that exists in **MongoDB Atlas**.
- Connect the application directly to that cluster using **MongoDBâ€™s native drivers**.
- Setup **dotenv-flow** to add DB credentials.
- Develop the Express Server to run both Frontend & Backend.
- Use **Postman** to test the API requests.

### Hosting

- Create the **AWS EC2** instance.
- Use **SSH protocol** to connect with the EC2 instance.
- Setup **Forever** package to ensure server script runs forever.
- All the requests received to Port 80 reroute to Port 8000.
